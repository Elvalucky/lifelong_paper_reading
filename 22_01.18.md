# On the importance of cross-task features for class-incremental learning
## Backgroud 
For the class/task-incremental learning, the most effective method is replay strategies. It will cause the class-imbalance.
## Insights:
1. For the classifier: the higher biases and the norm of weights;
2. For the feature extractor: First, maintain previously learned intra-task features; Second, create cross-task features; Third, knowledge transfer.
## Aim & Method

# Reparameterizing Convolutions for Incremental Multi-Task Learning without Task Interference
## Previous method 
1. For multi-task, encoder-focused approches are about encoding shared and task-specific information; decoder-focused approaches are to distill and refine cross-task information at the decoding stage.
2. filter-wise decomposition include a product of low-rank filters, filter groups, a basis of filter groups;
3. tensor-wise decomposition include SVD decomposition, CP- decomposition, Tucker decomposition, Tensor-Train decomposition.
## Exist Issue in MTL
1. catastrophic forgetting
2. task interference(negative transfer)

(1) the tasks have conflicting gradient directions during the update step of the shared feature representations. It caused by updating the parameters of the shared layers.
   
(2) the inspired related to curriculum: sort the order of task learning[1] or adapt the feature sharing between ‘related’ and ‘unrelated’ tasks[2].
## Method（investigate the training of parts of the network）
1. Buliding on the task-conditional direction, that for each task, every time activating a set of task-specific residual responses on top of the shared responses.
2. We decompose each convolutional operation into two components: a shared and a task-specific part.
3. reparameterize the convolutions, so the architectures can be decomposed into a non-trainable shared part(filter bank) and task-specific parts(modulators) which has a fraction of the filter bank parameters for adapt common knowledge uniquely for each task.
